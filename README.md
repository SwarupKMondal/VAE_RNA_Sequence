# Variational Autoencoder For Single-Cell RNA Sequencing

# Dataset
The dataset used here is cortex.h5ad file. This dataset is essentially an annotated matrix, where each row corresponds to a cell and each column corresponds to a gene.

# Model Pipeline
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Data filtering
3. Implementation of VAE
4. Extraction of latent variable
5. Run K-Means Clustering on latent space to compute ARI Score

# Model training
For running the model in your local machine download the ipynb file and run it.

# Tech Used
1. Scanpy
2. Python
3. Matplotlib
